job4 was to update the repo and I have given sudo yum update -y command and tried to Build it
But it has given me an error specifying 
Started by user Srivalli
Running as SYSTEM
Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/job4
[job4] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/jenkins4646764430503410844.sh
+ sudo yum update -y

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified
Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
Finished: FAILURE
so the Build failed as jenkins doesn't have permissions to do the task with root user so we have to give jenkins sudo permission by giving
visudo and give jenkins         ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
Then I tried to execute again and it got through this time.
But it took lot of time to run this job as it is update of packages in centos machine
If it is taking long time at times you can even abort the job in the middle by closing the red botton pointed at Build number
