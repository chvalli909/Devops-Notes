I will track all the steps done while practising jenkins

First I created a vm using gcloud command thorugh cloud shell using this gcloud compute instances create jenkinsserver --zone=us-west4-b
--machine-type=e2-medium --create-disk=auto-delete=yes,boot=yes,device-name=jenkins,image=projects/centos-cloud/global/images/centos-7-v20221206,mode=rw,size=20
and then checked in Compute Engine whether the jenkins instance is created or not.

To run jenkins you should have java but when I checked after sshing into server using java -version it says -bash: java: command not found so first I need to 
install java into my centos machine using the command yum install fontconfig java-11-openjdk.

"yum" is a package manager command used primarily in Red Hat-based Linux distributions, such as Fedora and CentOS.

"install" is an argument passed to the "yum" command to specify that we want to install packages.

"fontconfig" is the name of the first package to be installed. Fontconfig is a library used to manage fonts on Linux systems.
It provides a way to configure and customize font settings for various applications.

"java-11-openjdk" is the name of the second package to be installed. It refers to OpenJDK 11, which is an open-source implementation of the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11.
OpenJDK allows you to run Java applications and develop software using the Java programming language.
