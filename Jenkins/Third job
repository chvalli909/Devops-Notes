In second job we created clone using manual steps but in this job we will try to clone it directly from Git using SCM Git option 
If it is a public repo it will not ask for credentials but if it is a private one you have to give credentials and then have to Build the job.
when I tried to build the job it failed and gave the outout as

Failure reason is they specified branch as main but in my Branch specifier in jenkins configuration by default it took master so I changed it to main 
and then the build got through and gave me the output as

Commit message: "chore(deps): update dependency google-auth to v2.21.0 (#1883)"
First time build. Skipping changelog.
Finished: SUCCESS

one more point to track here is when I check cd workspace/
[root@jenkinsserver workspace]# ls
job1  job2  job3
[root@jenkinsserver workspace]# ls job3
cloudbuild.yaml  docs  helm-chart  istio-manifests  kubernetes-manifests  kustomize  LICENSE  protos  README.md  release  skaffold.yaml  src  terraform
[root@jenkinsserver workspace]# ls job2
microservices-demo

In job2 the complete folder is being cloned as we did it manually by giving git clone in Exucute shell option
But in job3 entire code has been populated but not as a folder because we provided SCM option directly to clone it from repo without giving git clone.
