Whatever job you are performing those steps are all placed in /var/lib/jenkins/jobs section
All the data that has been populated after building the job will be present in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace section

In seond job I am trying to clone a repo 
But as Git is not installed in my vm it said the below error and failed to build.
Started by user Srivalli
Running as SYSTEM
Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/job2
[job2] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/jenkins8620327081045003846.sh
+ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
/tmp/jenkins8620327081045003846.sh: line 3: git: command not found
Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
Finished: FAILURE
so the next step is to install Git in my vm using yum install git -y as it is centos machine

I ran the job again and now the Build got succesful as we installed Git this time and the output is
Started by user Srivalli

[job2] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/jenkins7060459989039000746.sh
+ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
Cloning into 'microservices-demo'...
Finished: SUCCESS

And when i checked in ls /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/job2
microservices-demo could be seen
