Now we will learn about Build periodically and Poll scm options
This case may arise when the developer writes the code and you have to get 
those changes automatically from Git.

Build periodically is just like cron jobs you can give timeframe and it will trigger
build even though there is no change in Git.

Where as in Poll Scm here also you can give time frame and it triggers build only if there is 
change in Git.
