I am trying to install webserver in this job
so I went to build steps and performed these commands
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
I tried to Build the job and it got success
so I hit the public ip and the webserver page got populated which is httpd default page.

But here I got an use case in which I don't want to populate the default httpd page but 
I want to copy developer created html page from Git and then copy the file to webserver
so to solve this first I cloned the html page repo from Git and then copied the files to webserver
by configuring the fifth job itself again and added 2 more stepd to it.

Always check whatever chnages you do in /var/lib/jenkins/ home directory
then check in workspace all the jobs and their related data in it.
